# ENEL 645 Final Project 

Final project creating a CNN to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. CNN architecture and design is based off success with earlier assignments, class notes, and literature. 
Note this notebook was designed to be run on Google Colab, and draws its files from zip files uploaded to Google Drive prior to the code running.
